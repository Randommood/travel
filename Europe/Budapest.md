## Budapest

While in Budapest is to drink as much Palinka as you can (it's like fruit vodka) and eat as many strudels as possible (they have this kind with cheese that it's amazing).

Sights we went to in 2013

* St Stephen Basilica - If you can stay for one of the concerts do. We listened to an amazing violin solo http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/Hungary/Budapest_Fovaros/Budapest-436839/Things_To_Do-Budapest-St_Stephens_Basilica_Szent_Istvan_Bazilika-BR-1.html

Restaurants
* Gundel - you want everything here. Their Palinka is amazing - my favorite was the pear one (and plum, and quince, and apple, fuck it have all of them)  http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/Hungary/Budapest_Fovaros/Budapest-436839/Restaurants-Budapest-Gundel-BR-1.html
Order the dessert strudels. They make them when you order and they are served warm.
