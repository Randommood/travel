## Budapest

What I like to do in Budapest is to drink as much Palinka as you can (it's like fruit vodka) and eat as many strudels as possible (they have this kind with cheese that it's amazing). This year howerver I've been focusing more on their wines, I have really enjoyed their blends, rose, and cabernet francs.

Restaurants
For the most part TripAdvisor does a good job of bubbling up the better restaurants. Here are my current favorites.
* Parisi 6 - https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274887-d6819273-Reviews-Parisi_6-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html best goulash soup so far and great prices
* Marvelosa - http://www.marvelosa.eu/ less great than last year
* Recommended to me - http://www.zsakbamacska.info/start.html will try the next time I visit
* Recommended - http://www.szegedvendeglo.hu/en/bemutatkozas

Coffee and cakes
* Ruszurm - Best strudel place I visited in the last 3 years - http://www.ruszwurm.hu/ Best is to go right when they open at 10am to beat the crowds and ensure they are not out of anything. Bonus points if it's a weekend day since they make special editions of the sour cherry and apple strudels.
* Second best strudel place -  http://www.reteshaz.com/ - it's the first strudel house of the Pest side. A bit pricier than Ruszurm but a bit roomier and you can often see them making strudels
* Central cafe - http://www.centralkavehaz.hu/eng/ - cute but not the one I was looking for. I wanted the New York Cafe

Wine
* [City and Wine tour](http://cityandwine.hu/en). Lovely tour, Etyek is a super pretty region and the wineries we visited were tiny producers. Glad I did it, [Tripadvisor reviews](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g274887-d3548341-Reviews-City_and_Wine_Tours-Budapest_Central_Hungary.html) agree.
* http://www.budapestbylocals.com/wine-tasting-in-buda-castle.html - to try next year


### 2016 Sights

* Mathias church (first visit) - http://hungarianparliament.com/tours/ I loved this church, I found it prettier than St Stephen's and very unique. http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/Hungary/Budapest_Fovaros/Budapest-436839/Things_To_Do-Budapest-Mathias_Church_Matyas_templom-BR-1.html
* Parliament house - http://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Europe/Hungary/Budapest_Fovaros/Budapest-436839/Things_To_Do-Budapest-Parliament_Orszaghaz-BR-1.html - best thing to do is to [get tour tickets online](http://hungarianparliament.com/tours/). You'll save yourself a lot of hassle
* Gell√©rt Hill - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell%C3%A9rt_Hill - Walked up the hill for a fantastic view of the city and checked out the citadel
