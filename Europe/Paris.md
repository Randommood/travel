### Food
We really enjoyed this place:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/le-comptoir-du-relais-paris
We went back twice, it's affordable and amazing. Do the 15 euro liter of wine, it's fantastic!

This place was also super great: http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-constant-paris-2

We LOVED this place: http://www.yelp.com/biz/arnaud-delmontel-paris-2 If you can visit it as many times as possible do. We would wake up, walk to it, buy bread and cheese in the same street and have a blast. Carbs galore. There are tons of cheese/bakeries/coffee houses in the street this bakery is in. Walking distance from the airbnb I recommended. We were regulars at a few places.


### Museums
You want to get a Paris Museum Pass...totally worth buying if you guys plan on going to multiple museums because it usually lets you skip the lines. We grabbed ours at the first location listed here (News Kiosk, 2 rue de la Legion d'Honneur, just outside the d'Orsay): http://en.parismuseumpass.com/rub-the-pass-points-of-sale-3.htm?cat=1&type=33. Musee d'Orsay and Musee de l'Orangerie are absolutely awesome. Tuileries Garden, in which Musee de l'Orangerie is located, is crazy gorgeous.  Note that you need cash to buy this.
