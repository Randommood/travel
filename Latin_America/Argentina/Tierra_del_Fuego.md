Last time I was there I also took an air tour of the city and really enjoyed it. It left from the air club and was not super expensive. 

* Eat pastries at Tante Sara - http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312855-d1744275-Reviews-Tante_Sara_Restaurant_Bar-Ushuaia_Province_of_Tierra_del_Fuego_Patagonia.html

* If you have a car visit the town of Tolhuin and buy pastries at the Panaderia La Union - it's a staple of the Island. http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1102963-d2384835-Reviews-Panaderia_La_Union-Tolhuin_Province_of_Tierra_del_Fuego_Patagonia.html
