### Buenos Aires

Buenos Aires is really nice. My recommendation is for you to stay in the Palermo Soho area. When you fly into buenos aires you'll have to take a shuttle or cab. Use these guys (Manuel Tienda Leon - http://www.tiendaleon.com/home/) ask them what the flat fee is to get you to the airbnb to avoid getting scammed.

Visit Puerto Madero, it's very pretty http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Madero| http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g312741-d311777-Reviews-Puerto_Madero-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html

Recoleta is another super nice neighborhood you have to see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recoleta,_Buenos_Aires| http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g312741-d311775-Reviews-Recoleta-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html
Eva Peron's body is in their cemetery (I have a few pictures of this on my Facebook album: https://www.facebook.com/InesSombra/media_set?set=a.611425107052.2163565.3111644&type=3 )

La Boca is a picturesque staple of the city: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Boca| http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g312741-d311772-Reviews-La_Boca-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.htmlIt's where tango started. 

And if you are into touristy things do a Tango show. We really enjoyed this one http://www.esquinacarlosgardel.com.ar/ I'd even go see it again.

A tip: try to bring cash as the exchange rate greatly favors cash. People can't easily buy dollars so be cautious when handling money (but you will get more for your money). Exchange it in restaurants or clothing stores. For example the official dollar when I went was at 6.5 pesos to the dollar but stores or people would give you anywhere from 8 to 10 pesos for one dollar. 

If you want a leather coat you should check out this store while you are there: http://shop.doma-leather.com/

If you are into steak go here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-remanseros-buenos-aires I single handedly killed one Bife the chorizo mariposa. It's cash only.
