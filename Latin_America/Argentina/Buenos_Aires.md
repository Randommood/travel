### Buenos Aires

Buenos Aires is really nice. My recommendation is for you to stay in the Palermo Soho area. When you fly into buenos aires you'll have to take a shuttle or cab. Use these guys (Manuel Tienda Leon - http://www.tiendaleon.com/home/) ask them what the flat fee is to get you to the airbnb to avoid getting scammed.

Visit Puerto Madero, it's very pretty http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Madero| http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g312741-d311777-Reviews-Puerto_Madero-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html

Recoleta is another super nice neighborhood you have to see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recoleta,_Buenos_Aires| http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g312741-d311775-Reviews-Recoleta-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html
Eva Peron's body is in their cemetery (I have a few pictures of this on my Facebook album: https://www.facebook.com/InesSombra/media_set?set=a.611425107052.2163565.3111644&type=3 )

La Boca is a picturesque staple of the city: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Boca| http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g312741-d311772-Reviews-La_Boca-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.htmlIt's where tango started. 

And if you are into touristy things do a Tango show. We really enjoyed this one http://www.esquinacarlosgardel.com.ar/ I'd even go see it again.

A tip: try to bring cash as the exchange rate greatly favors cash. People can't easily buy dollars so be cautious when handling money (but you will get more for your money). Exchange it in restaurants or clothing stores. For example the official dollar when I went was at 6.5 pesos to the dollar but stores or people would give you anywhere from 8 to 10 pesos for one dollar. 

If you want a leather coat you should check out this store while you are there: http://shop.doma-leather.com/

If you are into steak go here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/los-remanseros-buenos-aires I single handedly killed one Bife the chorizo mariposa. It's cash only.


### From my friend Jane

* We highly recommend the [BA Free Tour](http://www.bafreetour.com/english-buenos-aires-free-city-tour). We did the afternoon tour, starting at 5 pm. But the morning tour must be pretty good too because a lot of people from the morning tour came to the afternoon tour. It’s free, but you pay what you want to pay at the end.
* We enjoyed our afternoon at the [MALBA art gallery](http://www.malba.org.ar/). Unfortunately the Antonio Berni exhibition that we saw has just finished.

In Palermo, we’d recommend the following places for coffee, drinks, meals, etc:

Coffee:
* [Lab training center and coffee shop](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312741-d7229087-Reviews-Lab_Training_Center_Coffee_Shop-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html). We couldn’t stay away from this place; their coffee was the best.

Bars:
* [Victoria Brown](http://victoriabrownbar.com/) During the day it’s a comfortable coffee shop (Acco goes there to hang out before work). A night it is a trendy bar with fancy drinks (they don’t serve Fernet & Coke) at US prices in a very cool steam-punk inspired space.
* [Duarte](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312741-d3820307-Reviews-Duarte-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html) A friendly, comfortable bar (the menu looked pretty good too). We liked it a lot.

Restaurants:
* [Adentro Dinner Club](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312741-d2601533-Reviews-Adentro_Dinner_Club-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html). We had a very fun night here: it’s a “closed-door” restaurant. A couple cook and serve a meal in their home. She’s american so there is no language barrier. The night we went there was a couple from Singapore, a couple from Australia and a couple from North Carolina — all really interesting, even the couple from N.C. The food was good but the atmosphere (like a well planned dinner party) was the star feature.
* [Don Julio](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312741-d1066728-Reviews-Don_Julio-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html). Good steak in Palermo Soho. We went mid-afternoon for late lunch and that worked well for us — walk in without lines or crowds.
* [La Costilla](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312741-d7198871-Reviews-La_Costilla-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html). Another good steak in Palermo Soho. Good value for Palermo — take cash for the 15% discount.
* [Armenia Club](http://www.armeniarestaurant.com.ar/portada.htm). For something other than steak. It is on Armenia between Vega and Cabrera. It’s on the second floor of the Armenian cultural center. The food and service was good, but it did have that special “cultural center” feel to it that makes it a bit different from a normal restaurant. We had some tasty vegetable dishes here :) On Thursday night they have tango lessons on the lower floor. (The restaurant is on the second floor.)

Sleeps:
* [Rendez Vous Boutique Hotel Buenos Aires](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g312741-d1758713-Reviews-Rendez_Vous_Hotel_Buenos_Aires-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html)
