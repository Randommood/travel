### Mendoza

From my friend Jane

* We ate out only one night, at [El Patio Jesus Maria](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312781-d1503361-Reviews-El_Patio_Jesus_Maria-Mendoza_Province_of_Mendoza_Cuyo.html)  (address Aristides Villanueva y Boulogne Sur Mer - 5ta seccion, near the entrance to the Park General San Martín). We ate steak and salad and morcilla, we shared the generous portions.It was one of our best meals during the trip.

* We drove up to the [Cerro de la Gloria](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g312781-d551292-Reviews-The_Hill_of_Glory_Cerro_de_la_Gloria-Mendoza_Province_of_Mendoza_Cuyo.html) in the General San Martín park and got out for a look around. It is an impressive monument and the views from the hill are gorgeous.

#### Wine

There are an overwhelming number of wineries to visit. And many of them seem to want you to make an appointment in advance. It can be helpful to have a Spanish speaker to do some phoning around for you.

Wineries we visited:

* [Viña Cobos](http://www.vinacobos.com/) because we know Paul Hobbs wines in California. It was very high end and the tasting was expensive but beautiful.
* [Ruca Malen](http://www.bodegarucamalen.com/), I’d recommend this for the solid combination of quality wine and a good tour.
* [Zuccardi](http://www.familiazuccardi.com/home_en.php) had a good tour but the tasting portion was short and poor. (I think it was free, though.)

We stopped for lunch at the [Septima winery](http://www.bodegaseptima.com/bodega.php?lg=en): Lunch was very fancy; we thought it would cost a fortune, but it didn’t. The building is huge — pharaonic and we got some great photos there. We didn’t do a tasting because we didn’t have time.
