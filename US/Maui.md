So Maui is a bit spread out and you'll need a car. Once you do you can go anywhere. I don't recommend making the road to Hana if you
have very few days (takes a full day). Also if you get carsick it is likely you'll have a bad time driving to Hana.

We absolutely loved this spot. We returned 3 times during our 4 days in Maui and I think we'll stay there the next time we visit Maui.
First days we snorkeled on our own, had food at the pool restaurant in the resort and we saw two turtles, tons of fish, and the coral is
beautiful. We were staying at Kanapali Beach and Black Rock was a bit rough for me so this spot worked out better.

[Kai Kanai](http://www.kaikanani.com/) - We stumbled upon this tour on the last day of our visit and it was fantastic. I highly recommend you take it. It leaves around 8:30am from Makena beach and they give you breakfast, lunch, and a happy hour (they have good beer on tap in the sailboat). The crew is
super fun and the locations they picked for snorkeling were among the best ones I've seen. They take you to Molokini crater and a few more
spots. I kept thinking that it was the best money I ever spent. The coral was amazing, saw whales, turtles, and dolphins.

### Food

[Lelanis on the Beach - Beachside Grill](http://www.leilanis.com/menus/beachside-grill)
Sit at the bar for killer Mai-Tais (we spent new year drinking Mai-Tais - they come in tiki glasses). Converse with the bartender and
he'll start making them stronger, it helps if you critizice people for their shitty choice of drinks (bud light), he seemed to appreciate the
comment.

Cheeseburger in paradise has a reasonably alcoholic Mai-Tai but it is not as interesting as the ones with pommegranate juice and it's a
restaurant chain. We only stopped in the ones whose location gave you super pretty views.

Lahaina was fun and it has tons of people walking at night. Monkeypod was a nice restaurant and Yelp is pretty alright when it comes to
local recommendations.

Breakfast at the [Chez Meme bistro & bakery](http://www.yelp.com/biz/chez-meme-bistro-and-bakery-kihei) was awesome, we returned to it several times while in town.

[Migrant](http://www.yelp.com/biz/migrant-kihei-2) is a fancier restaurant choice by a Top Chef contestant.
