So Maui is a bit spread out and you'll need a car. Once you do you can go anywhere. I don't recommend making the road to Hana if you
have very few days (takes a full day). Also if you get carsick it is likely you'll have a bad time driving to Hana.

We absolutely loved this spot. We returned 3 times during our 4 days in Maui and I think we'll stay there the next time we visit Maui.
First days we snorkeled on our own, had food at the pool restaurant in the resort and we saw two turtles, tons of fish, and the coral is
beautiful. We were staying at Kanapali Beach and Black Rock was a bit rough for me so this spot worked out better.

[Kai Kanai](http://www.kaikanani.com/) - We stumbled upon this tour on the last day of our visit and it was fantastic. I highly recommend you take it. It leaves around 8:30am from Makena beach and they give you breakfast, lunch, and a happy hour (they have good beer on tap in the sailboat). The crew is
super fun and the locations they picked for snorkeling were among the best ones I've seen. They take you to Molokini crater and a few more
spots. I kept thinking that it was the best money I ever spent. The coral was amazing, saw whales, turtles, and dolphins.
